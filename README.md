# Behaviorial Cloning Project

## Introduction

This is my solution to the self-driving car nano-degree behaviourial cloning
project.

## The Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

## Files

My solution to the project consists of the following files:

* [model.py](model.py) - Source code used to train my neural network
* [drive.py](drive.py) - Unmodified script used to drive the car in autonomous mode
* [model.h5](model.h5) - Saved and trained model.
* [writeup_report.md](writeup_report.md) - Detailed writeup for my project solution
* [video.mp4](video.mp4) - Video of my car driving around the track in autonomous mode
